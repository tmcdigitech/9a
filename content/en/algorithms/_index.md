## Tasks
### Sequence
1. Write a program that prints `Hello, World!` to the screen.
2. Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.

### Selection
3. Adapt program 2 so that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names. *(Hint: start with only greeting users named Alice.)*

### Iteration
4. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n.
5. Adapt program 4 so that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17.
6. Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.
7. Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. *(Extension: It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.)*

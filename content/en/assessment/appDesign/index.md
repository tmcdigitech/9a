Your task is to design and prototype a simple app which solves some specified problem. The app must control some real hardware connected to a Rasperry Pi Pico. For example, you could build a home-automation interface, a burglar alarm, or maybe a set of accessible traffic lights.

Use this [template](AppPlanning.docx) to plan and document your work.

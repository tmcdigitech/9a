Your task is to design and prototype a simple app which solves some specified problem. The app must control some real hardware connected to a Rasperry Pi Pico. For example, you could build a home-automation interface, a burglar alarm, or maybe a set of accessible traffic lights.

Use this [template](AppPlanning.docx) to plan and document your work.

The first time you connect your Pico, you may need to copy [this file](https://downloads.circuitpython.org/bin/raspberry_pi_pico_w/en_US/adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico_w-en_US-8.0.5.uf2)

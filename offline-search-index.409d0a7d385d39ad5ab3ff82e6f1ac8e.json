So as programmers we use colors, even though we would normally spell the word colours.\nColors are described by the amount of red, green, and blue light to emit, using numbers in the range 0 to 255. In Python, we list these as a tuple (red, green, blue), such as:\n(0, 150, 255) The built-in RGB LED on your Gemma (a DotStar) has these three color components, so we set its color in this way.\nThe NeoPixel RGB LEDs you will solder onto your Gemma have four components: the usual red, green, and blue and also white. So you if you wanted the above color on your Neopixel LED strip, you would use:\n(0, 150, 255, 0) Unless you want to set a particular LED pixel to be white in color, it is recommended that you set the white value to zero (0), as the white tends to wash out the colors otherwise.\nYou can use the Google Color Picker to find different colors, and then copy the RGB value listed. Don’t forget to add a value for the white (probably zero) after the other three numbers, if you are setting NeoPixel colors.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"In almost all programming, American spellings are used.

Note that counting begins at zero. Think of the number as “how far from the beginning” the element in the list is. So vowels[0] is the element at the start of the list, and vowels[3] is three elements further down the list. So the string \"u\" in that list would be vowels[4].\nAdding elements You can add elements to the end of a list with the append() function.\nsquares.append(49) print(squares[7]) # Output: 49 Removing elements You can remove elements from a list with remove() and pop().\nfriends = [\"Nhi\", \"David\", \"Hari\", \"Zahra\"] friends.remove(\"David\") print(friends) # Output: [\"Nhi, \"Hari\", \"Zahra\"] If there are multiple elements in the list with the same value, remove() will remove just the first one.\nfriends = [\"Nhi\", \"David\", \"Hari\", \"Zahra\"] exBestie = friends.pop(0) print(friends) # Output: [\"David\", \"Hari\", \"Zahra\"] print(exBestie) # Output: \"Nhi\" ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A list is a data structure for storing a series of related pieces of …","ref":"/9a/glossary/list/","tags":"","title":"list"},{"body":"When defining a function, the pieces of information that the function takes to do its job are called parameters.

For example, whole numbers and decimal numbers are stored differently.\nSome common data types you’ll encounter are:\nintegers (int) Integers are whole numbers, and can be positive or negative. floating point numbers (float and double) Floating point numbers (commonly called floats) are for storing decimal numbers. The number is stored in scientific notation, with a mantissa and exponent. $$\\overbrace{3.18}^{\\text{mantissa}}\\times 10^{\\overbrace{-7}^{\\text{exponent}}}$$ There is a limited number of digits for the mantissa and the exponent. If you need more, a double precision floating point number (or double for short) has twice the space, so can store a more precise mantissa, and a larger exponent.\ncharacters (char) A character is a single letter, digit, punctuation mark, or piece of whitespace (a space, newline, tab, etc.). strings (string) Strings are so called because they are ‘strings of characters’. They are usually indicated with double quotes “like this”. In some languages, like Python, strings can be in single quotes as well, ’like this’.

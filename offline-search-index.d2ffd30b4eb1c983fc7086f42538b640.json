But it works!\nThinking about what we need We will need a field to enter the temperature into, and a field to display the converted temperature. We’ll also need variables to hold those two numbers. We’ll need a button to convert to C and a button to convert to F, and each will need a function that is called when the button is pressed.\nFor consistency, we’ll settle on these names:\nname function tempIn variable holding input temperature inField field for entering temperature tempOut variable holding output temperature outField field for displaying output toCButton button for converting to °C toC function that converts from °F to °C toFButton button for converting to °F toF function that converts from °C to °F Make the UI elements Let’s add the variables and the user interface elements. These have to go above the root.mainloop() line, as that needs to be the very last line in the program.\ntempIn = tk.DoubleVar(value=-40) inField = tk.Entry(textvariable=tempIn) inField.pack() tempOut = tk.StringVar(value=\"-40°C = -40°F\") outField = tk.Label(textvariable=tempOut) outField.pack() toCButton = tk.Button(text=\"to °C\") toCButton.pack() toFButton = tk.Button(text=\"to °F\") toFButton.pack() At this point we have all the front panel bits we need — we’ll tidy up the layout a bit later!\nWire up the panel Now that the front is more or less in place, we can start writing the code which will connect everything together.\nLet’s start with the function that converts to °F. Put this up the top of your file, just after the import lines.\ndef toF(): global tempIn global tempOut c = tempIn.get() f = c*1.8 + 32 tempOut.set(f\"{c}°C = {f}°F\") Tkinter’s variables (StringVar, DoubleVar, IntVar and so on) wrap Python’s usual types up with some helper stuff to make the GUI process work nicely. As a result, we need to extract the actual temperature value from the variable using the .get() function.\nWe can then do the calculation to convert to °F. Finally, we can .set() the tempOut variable, which will be reflected on the GUI.\nThat takes care of the function, but now we need to make sure it gets called when the button is pressed.\nFind the line that defines toFButton and change it from this:\ntoFButton = tk.Button(text=\"to °F\") to this:\ntoFButton = tk.Button(text=\"to °F\", command=toF) We can now go ahead and repeat the process for converting to °C.\ndef toC(): global tempIn global tempOut f = tempIn.get() c = (f-32)/1.8 tempOut.set(f\"{f}°F = {c}°C\") And similarly, we need to update the toCButton definition to call the function when pressed.\ntoCButton = tk.Button(text=\"to °C\", command=toF) Code so far At this point, our code looks like this:\nimport tkinter as tk def toF(): global tempIn global tempOut c = tempIn.get() f = c*1.8 + 32 tempOut.set(f\"{c}°C = {f}°F\") def toC(): global tempIn global tempOut f = tempIn.get() c = (f-32)/1.8 tempOut.set(f\"{f}°F = {c}°C\") root = tk.Tk() tempIn = tk.DoubleVar(value=-40) inField = tk.Entry(textvariable=tempIn) inField.pack() tempOut = tk.StringVar(value=\"-40°C = -40°F\") outField = tk.Label(textvariable=tempOut) outField.pack() toCButton = tk.Button(text=\"to °C\", command=toC) toCButton.pack() toFButton = tk.Button(text=\"to °F\", command=toF) toFButton.pack() root.mainloop() ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Let’s start with a very simple utility that converts temperatures …","ref":"/9a/appdesign/firstapp/","tags":"","title":"First app"},{"body":"In this walkthrough we will make a noughts \u0026 crosses (tic-tac-toe) game using a 3x3 grid of buttons.\nAs we go through this, you might find yourself thinking “there must be a better way to do this”. You are probably right; there are some things we will do which could definitely be improved on, and we’ll come back to them later. For now, we’ll keep it simple, if repetitive and clunky.\nLet’s start with the basics:\n1 2 3 4 5 import tkinter as tk root = tk.Tk() root.mainloop() Grid setup We set up the grid structure, which is three columns with equal weight (width):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 import tkinter as tk root = tk.Tk() root.columnconfigure(0,weight=1) root.columnconfigure(1,weight=1) root.columnconfigure(2,weight=1) root.mainloop() Button layout We’ll number each of the nine buttons, which will be arranged like this:\nColumn 0 1 2 +------ R 0| 1 2 3 o 1| 4 5 6 w 2| 7 8 9 Let’s make the buttons. Each button’s construction looks like this:\nb1 = tk.Button() b1.config(command=lambda: move(b1)) b1.grid(column=0, row=0) for each of b1 to b9. We need to set the column and row (so b6 has column=2, row=1 for example).\nThe middle line sets the command that should be triggered when the button is pressed. Rather than writing nine separate identical functions (one for each button), we can create one function that they all trigger and just pass in which button was pressed as a parameter. The command= part takes the name of a function, so if we want to pass in a parameter as well, we need to use a lambda function (a function body without a name). We could also have used a partial function, which we won’t describe further here. Because we need to pass our button’s variable in as a parameter to the function, we need to have declared it first, which is why we define the command in a separate call to config, and not in the line that creates the button, as we have before.\nSo go ahead and make nine copies of that, making sure that you replace b1 with the appropriate button number in the four places it appears, and that you get the columns and rows correct.\nRun your function now, and check that you have a grid of nine buttons.\nStarting to move Let’s start making our move function. When you move, we want to disable the button, so that nobody can make the same move again.quickly knock up an empty function so we can test things out:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 import tkinter as tk def move(b): b['state'] = 'disabled' root = tk.Tk() root.columnconfigure(0,weight=1) root.columnconfigure(1,weight=1) root.columnconfigure(2,weight=1) b1 = tk.Button() b1.config(command=lambda: move(b1)) b1.grid(column=0,row=0) # more buttons here... b9 = tk.Button() b9.config(command=lambda: move(b9)) b9.grid(column=2,row=2) root.mainloop() Let’s focus some more on the move command. When a button is pressed, we want to mark the button with a player’s token (either ⭕️ or ❌). To do that we need to keep track of whose move it is and change it each time someone moves. So we will make a list of the player tokens, and a variable nextMove to keep track of which one is moving next.\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 nextMove = 0 players = ['⭕️','❌'] def move(b): global nextMove b['state']='disabled' b['text'] = players[nextMove] nextMove = (nextMove+1)%2 At this point we can make moves. We now need to tackle the various ways in which the game might end. Let’s first handle the case of a draw.\nIt’s a draw If each square has been used and nobody has yet won, then the game is a draw. There are several ways we could keep track do this, but the easiest is probably to just count the number of moves that have been made, and to declare a draw when that number gets to 9. Alternatively, count how many moves are left and declare a draw when that number reaches 0.\nWe’re not going to do anything fancy when it is a draw. We’re just going to reset the board immediately. To do that, we’ll need a reset function.\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 nextMove = 0 players = ['⭕️','❌'] movesLeft = 9 def move(b): global nextMove, movesLeft b['state'] = 'disabled' b['text'] = players[nextMove] nextMove = (nextMove+1)%2 movesLeft -= 1 if movesLeft == 0: reset() def reset(): for b in [b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9]: b['state'] = 'normal' b['text'] = '—' Run the program, and check that it resets at the end. But can you find the bug lurking in our reset code?\nIf you play a second game, the program will not correctly reset at the end of the second game. Why is that?\nAfter line 11, where we decrement movesLeft, add a line saying print(movesLeft). This is called a test print. We’re not planning to have this line in the finished program, but it is really helpful to see what the program is up to while you’re developing and debugging it.\nIf you watch the moves left now, you’ll notice that while the board resets at the end of the first game, the counter continues to count down into negatives. As a result, the counter doesn’t reach zero to signal the end of the second game. We will need to reset the counter in our reset function.\n15 16 17 18 19 def reset(): for b in [b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9]: b['state'] = 'normal' b['text'] = '—' movesLeft = 9 Check that you can play multiple games and the counter is resetting correctly. You will notice it is still broken!\nYou can now safely remove that test print.\nFor the win Again, there are several ways we could try and tackle monitoring a win. Here’s what we’re going to do this time. To win you must get 3-in-a-row, which can be done in one of eight ways:\ntop row middle row bottom row left column centre column right column forward diagonal backward diagonal If we check after each move if all three of the squares for each of those eight combinations is the same, we’ll know that there is a win. Let’s write a function to do that:\ndef winCheck(): if b1['text'] in players and b1['text'] == b2['text'] and b2['text'] == b3['text']: tk.messagebox.showinfo(title='Game over!', message=f\"{b1['text']} wins\") return b1['text'] if b4['text'] in players and b4['text'] == b5['text'] and b5['text'] == b6['text']: tk.messagebox.showinfo(title='Game over!', message=f\"{b4['text']} wins\") return b4['text'] # and so on Note that we can’t chain equals signs together like this:\nif b1['text'] == b1['text'] == b1['text']: That has a meaning (so it will run without an error) but it won’t do what you want.\nThe b1['text'] in players condition checks to see if the text is one of the player symbols and not blank or the dash we’re using when we run reset(). Otherwise a blank row or column would trigger the win condition.\nLastly, the showinfo function displays a popup box with the set title and message. We will need to import the function in order to do this. Add this line just under the import tkinter as tk line:\nfrom tkinter.messagebox import showinfo Finish off this (inelegant) function to handle all eight cases.\nSo the winCheck function will check if there is a winner, pop up a message with the winner, and return the winner to whatever called it, or False if there isn’t a winner yet. So we can now run this check each time someone moves, just before we check for a draw (because we want a win on the last move to count as a win, not a draw).\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 def move(b): global nextMove, movesLeft b['state']='disabled' b['text'] = players[nextMove] nextMove = (nextMove+1)%2 movesLeft -= 1 if winCheck() is not False: reset() if movesLeft == 0: reset() ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"In this walkthrough we will make a noughts \u0026 crosses (tic-tac-toe) …","ref":"/9a/appdesign/tktactoe/","tags":"","title":"Tk Tac Toe"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/9a/glossary/","tags":"","title":"Glossary"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/9a/appdesign/reference/","tags":"","title":"Reference"},{"body":"Purpose Practice and apply coding skills and computational thinking skills and knowledge in preparation for the individual programming project.\nTask Description Complete and submit each of the exercises in the Sequence, Selection, and Iteration sets.\nFollow this link to hand in your files.\nTo Be Successful Complete and demonstrate the above features with internal comments for all code.\nLearning Behaviours This task provides the following opportunities to develop and demonstrate the Learner Behaviours:\nDriven Engages in all the aspects of the Design Process with initiative and seeks feedback during the development of their project.

So as programmers we use colors, even though we would normally spell the word colours.\nColors are described by the amount of red, green, and blue light to emit, using numbers in the range 0 to 255. In Python, we list these as a tuple (red, green, blue), such as:\n(0, 150, 255) The built-in RGB LED on your Gemma (a DotStar) has these three color components, so we set its color in this way.\nThe NeoPixel RGB LEDs you will solder onto your Gemma have four components: the usual red, green, and blue and also white. So you if you wanted the above color on your Neopixel LED strip, you would use:\n(0, 150, 255, 0) Unless you want to set a particular LED pixel to be white in color, it is recommended that you set the white value to zero (0), as the white tends to wash out the colors otherwise.\nYou can use the Google Color Picker to find different colors, and then copy the RGB value listed. Don’t forget to add a value for the white (probably zero) after the other three numbers, if you are setting NeoPixel colors.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"In almost all programming, American spellings are used.

For example, whole numbers and decimal numbers are stored differently.\nSome common data types you’ll encounter are:\nintegers (int) Integers are whole numbers, and can be positive or negative. floating point numbers (float and double) Floating point numbers (commonly called floats) are for storing decimal numbers. The number is stored in scientific notation, with a mantissa and exponent. $$\\overbrace{3.18}^{\\text{mantissa}}\\times 10^{\\overbrace{-7}^{\\text{exponent}}}$$ There is a limited number of digits for the mantissa and the exponent. If you need more, a double precision floating point number (or double for short) has twice the space, so can store a more precise mantissa, and a larger exponent.\ncharacters (char) A character is a single letter, digit, punctuation mark, or piece of whitespace (a space, newline, tab, etc.). strings (string) Strings are so called because they are ‘strings of characters’. They are usually indicated with double quotes “like this”. In some languages, like Python, strings can be in single quotes as well, ’like this’.
